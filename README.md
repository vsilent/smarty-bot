smarty-bot
==========

Smarty-bot is a personal bot which is aimed to keep well organized scripts and execute them easy.

It is also for those who just started to learn programming in Python.<br>
For now it is just a very simple chat bot which can interpret some natural language commands into python script execution.
In the future it is going to be more than just a chat bot but transform natural language commands into real actions ( turn on lights, making coffee :) ) . <br>

This is not a ready for use product, it is still under development!<br><br>
